I did online research on Diataxis and created templates for the four Diataxis categories: overview, tutorial, guide, and reference. I wrote guidelines on how to use the templates and provided examples of each template filled out with sample content. Each template includes reusable sections, content rules, and naming conventions. I shared the templates with my team at BigCommerce to gather feedback and improve the templates. \n\nOverall, this sample demonstrates how I apply documentation best practices to improve the usability of technical content. By using Diataxis principles, I help ensure that documentation meets diverse user needs, making it easier to find information based on specific goals and tasks.\n",
